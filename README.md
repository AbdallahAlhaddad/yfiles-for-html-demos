# yFiles for HTML Demo Sources

This repository contains source code demos that use the commercial [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/yfileshtml) software programming library for the visualization of graphs, diagrams, and networks. The library itself is __*not*__ part of this repository.

# Running the Demos

Most of the demos are hosted [online here](https://live.yworks.com/yfiles-for-html) for everyone to play with. Developers *need* to [evaluate the library](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html/evaluate), instead, since it is __*not*__ part of this repository. 
The evaluation version also contains these demos and the necessary library to execute the code, so *cloning this repository is neither necessary nor will it suffice*.
