# Angular CLI Demo

The Angular CLI Demo shows the integration of yFiles for HTML with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

To start the demo

1.  Go to the demo's directory `demos-js/toolkit/angular`.
2.  Run `npm install`.
3.  Run `npm start`.

This will compile the app and launch a debugging server that will serve the demo application. Source code changes will be compiled and displayed automatically.
