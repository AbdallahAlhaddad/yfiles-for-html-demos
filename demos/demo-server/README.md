## Prerequisites

Running the Demo Server requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed. If Node.js is installed, the command `npm` should be available in the path.

To install Node.js, go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer that is suitable for your system.

## Running the Demo Server

To run the Demo Server, execute

```
 > npm install
 > npm start

```

in this directory (`%YFILES_HTML_DISTRIBUTION_DIR%/demos-js/`).

The former installs the required node modules locally in the `node_modules` subdirectory of this directory.

The latter executes `server.js` using `node`. When the server is up and running, its welcome page should open in your browser. If it doesn't, please direct your browser to [http://localhost:4242/doc/readme/documentation.html](http://localhost:4242/doc/readme/documentation.html).
