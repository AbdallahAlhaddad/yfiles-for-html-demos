# Automatic Graph Layout

This step shows how to use the [layout algorithms](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/getting_started-layout) in yFiles for HTML to automatically place the graph elements.

Automatic layout is one of the main features of the yFiles products. The layout library provides a large set of ready-to-use, highly customizable algorithms for most scenarios. The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate how to run an arbitrary layout algorithm. For an overview of the available layout styles, please see [Layout Styles Demo](../../../demos-js/layout/layoutstyles/index.html).

- Click the 'Layout' button in the toolbar to run an automatic layout.
