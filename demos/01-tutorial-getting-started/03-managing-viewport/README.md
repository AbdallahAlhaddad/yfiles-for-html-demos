# Managing the Viewport

How to influence the viewport.

This step shows how to [work with the viewport](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/view_graphcontrol_managing-the-view). It introduces basic viewport handling such as zooming and "fit to content".

The graph consists of four nodes, from which only three belong to the viewport and thus, are visible. Press "fit to content" to include also the fourth node to the viewport.

See the sources for details.
