Getting Started Tutorial - StepÂ 8

# Grouped Graphs

Enabling and using the grouping feature.

This step shows how to configure support for grouped (or hierarchically organized) graphs. Note that collapse/expand functionality is introduced later in this tutorial.

[GraphEditorInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode) already provides the following default gestures for grouping/ungrouping:

- Press CTRL+G to group the currently selected nodes.
- Press CTRL+U to ungroup the currently selected nodes. Note that this does not automatically shrink the group node or remove it if it would be empty.
- Press SHIFT+CTRL+G to shrink a group node to its minimum size.
- Press SHIFT when dragging nodes into or out of groups to change the graph hierarchy.

See the sources for details.
