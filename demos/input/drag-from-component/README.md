# Drag From Component

This demo shows how to use the HTML5 Drag and Drop support to drag graph items from the component to other HTML elements.

## Things to Try

- Drag a node from the component to the element at the top right ("Drop Here").
- Drag a node from the component to the trashcan symbol to remove it from the graph.
- Edit the graph as usual. Note:
  - Dragging a node will let you drag it from the component.
  - Dragging a selected node while pressing the SHIFT key will move the node on the component.
  - Dragging an unselected node with SHIFT held down will start edge creation.
