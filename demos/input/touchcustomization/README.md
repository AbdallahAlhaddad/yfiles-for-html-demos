# Touch Interaction

This demo shows how a graph editor application can be optimized for touch devices.

## Things to Try

- Create nodes by dragging them from the palette into the canvas.
- Navigate the graph by dragging with one finger. Zoom with two fingers.
- Select a node by tapping it. Drag the node handles to change the node's size. Drag the node itself to move it around.
- Double Tap quickly on the empty canvas area to start the lasso selection tool. Release the finger to complete the selection gesture.
- Long Press a node or any other graph item to open the item's context menu.
- Long Press on the empty canvas area to open the background context menu.
- Create nodes using the background context menu.
- Create an edge by selecting "Create Edge" from a node's context menu.
- Change the "Snap Touch Panning" behavior using the selection box above the palette and see how it affects graph panning. "Horizontal" locks near-horizontal panning to the x-axis. "Vertical" does the same for the y-axis. "Both" snaps near-horizontal and near-vertical panning.
