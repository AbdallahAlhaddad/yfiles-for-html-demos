<aside class="demo-sidebar demo-left">
  <h1 class="demo-sidebar-header">Description</h1>
  <div class="demo-sidebar-content">
    <p>
      This demo shows how to load yFiles for HTML with <a href="https://wmr.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WMR</a>
      as a loader for efficient web development and easy builds.
    </p>
    <p>Also, a layout algorithm in a Web Worker thread without blocking the UI or main thread is loaded using
      <a href="https://wmr.dev/docs/web-workers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WMR's built-in support
      for Web Workers</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Things to Try</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wait for the demo to load and once the layout button has become active (when the Web Worker
        has initialized), push the layout button to run a layout asynchronously. The demo alternates
        between the Hierarchic and Organic layout styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make changes in the code and see how WMR's hot module reloading takes action.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Running the demo</h2>

    <p>First, install the required npm modules in the demo directory:</p>

    <code>
        > npm install
      </code>

    <h3>Development</h3>

    <p>
      For development, WMR offers convenient live reloading support to minimize turnaround times.
    </p>
    <p>To run the development server:</p>

    <code>
        > npm start
      </code>

    <p>
      When the server runs, try making changes to the source code and see how the app will be
      updated in the browser immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debugging of application files in the browser's developer tools should work fine,
      since the source files are only minimally preprocessed.
    </p>

    <h3>Production</h3>

    <p>
      WMR is capable of creating a highly optimized production build. No extra configuration
      is required.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that WMR's prerendering feature does not work with yFiles for HTML.
    </p>

    <p>To run the production build:</p>

    <code>
        > npm run build
      </code>
