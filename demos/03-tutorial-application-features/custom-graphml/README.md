# Export custom data in GraphML

This step shows how to [read and write data](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/customizing_io_serialization-basics) that is bound to graph elements to and from a GraphML file.

This is demonstrated with Date objects that are bound to the node by an [IMapper](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IMapper). Place the cursor over a node to view the bound object in a tooltip.

See the sources for details.
