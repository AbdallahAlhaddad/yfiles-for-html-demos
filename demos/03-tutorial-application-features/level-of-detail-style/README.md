Application Features Tutorial

# Level of Details

This demo shows how to display different styles depending on the current zoom level in order to implement a level of detail rendering.

In this demo three levels of zooming are implemented: **detail level**, **intermediate level** and **overview level**

- In **detail level**, the entire information is displayed on the node.
- In **intermediate level**, some of the node's information is rendered.
- In **overview level**, only the basic information is rendered.

## Things to Try

Zoom in and out to see the changes.
