## Graph Search

This demo shows an implementation of the search functionality on the nodes of a graph.

The search is performed on the labels of the nodes and those that match the queried term are being highlighted.

There exists also a separate graph search implementation in `demos-js/utils` package currently used by [these demos](../../README.html#search). This implementation can be extended to support custom search on graph elements.

See the sources for details.
