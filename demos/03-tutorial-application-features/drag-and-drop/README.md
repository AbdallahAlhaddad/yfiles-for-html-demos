## Drag and Drop

This demo shows how to use [NodeDropInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/NodeDropInputMode) for dragging nodes from a separate panel to drop them into the graph component.

- Drag nodes and group nodes into the graph.
- Drop nodes and group nodes on other group nodes to add them as their children.

See the sources for details.
