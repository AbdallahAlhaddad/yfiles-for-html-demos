# Filtering

This sample shows how to configure graph [filtering](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/filtering).

Through filtering we can temporarily remove nodes or edges from the graph.

## Things to Try

- Select graph items and press the **Filter Items** button to hide those items from the graph.
- Press the **Reset Filter** button to reinsert any filtered items in the graph.

See the sources for details.
