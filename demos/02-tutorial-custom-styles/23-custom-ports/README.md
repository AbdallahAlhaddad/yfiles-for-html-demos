This step shows a custom port style. In this case, the port is a transparent white circle.

## Things to Try

- Take a look at the port in the middle of the nodes.

## Left to Do

- Use the decorator pattern to add label edges to the nodes.
- Create a custom group node style.
- Render nodes with HTML5 canvas instead of SVG for improved performance, especially for large graphs.
- Add [bridge support](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/bridges-customizations) to the edge style.
