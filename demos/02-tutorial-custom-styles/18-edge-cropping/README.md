## Things to Try

- Take a look at method `MySimpleEdgeStyle#getPath()`.

## Left to Do

- Change the style of an edge when selected.
- Create a custom arrow which fits the style of the demo.
- Create a custom port style for nodes.
- Use the decorator pattern to add label edges to the nodes.
- Create a custom group node style.
