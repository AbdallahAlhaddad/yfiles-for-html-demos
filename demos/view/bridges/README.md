[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/view/bridges/index.html).

The Bridges demo showcases the capabilities of the [BridgeManager](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/BridgeManager) class for inserting bridges into edge paths.

In addition to bridges for edge-edge intersections, this demo shows bridges for other obstacles like group node boundaries as well.

## Things to Try

- Create new edges and move existing nodes and bends to create new bridges.
- Explore the settings of the [BridgeManager](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/BridgeManager) using the toolbar's combo boxes.
