[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/view/printing/index.html).

The Printing demo shows how to export a graph or a part of it to vector graphics (SVG) on the client and how to print this graphic.

## Things to Try

- Resize and move the export rectangle to control the region which will be printed.
- Press the `Print` button to open a new browser window with the exported SVG and trigger the printing.
- Disable `Use Clipping Rectangle` to ignore the export region rectangle and export the complete graph instead.
- Play with the settings to see how different settings affect the outcome.
