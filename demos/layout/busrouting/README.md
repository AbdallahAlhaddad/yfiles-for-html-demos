[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/layout/busrouting/index.html).

This demo shows how to create bus structures using [EdgeRouter](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/EdgeRouter).

## Things to Try

- Create new nodes by left clicking on the graph.
- Click the "Connect Nodes" button to connect the selected nodes with edges. The algorithm creates a complete subgraph between all selected nodes and routes the subgraph edges only.
- The "Route" button routes all edges in the graph. Edges will be assigned to busses depending on their color.
