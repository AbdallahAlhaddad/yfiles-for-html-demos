[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/layout/subcomponents/index.html).

This demo shows how hierarchic layout can arrange selected subcomponents of a graph with different layout styles.

Available styles are tree, organic, or orthogonal style, or a hierarchic style with different settings than the main layout.

## Things to Try

- Add nodes to a new subcomponent that gets an individual layout. Select some nodes, chose a layout algorithm and style, and hit ![](../../resources/icons/plus2-16.svg). Then the new subcomponent is marked with a color and the layout is updated.
- Remove nodes from subcomponents. Select some nodes and press ![](../../resources/icons/minus2-16.svg). Those nodes are removed from their subcomponents.
