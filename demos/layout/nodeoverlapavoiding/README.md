[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/layout/nodeoverlapavoiding/index.html).

A demo that shows how to interactively edit graphs without creating overlaps.

Every time a node is added, moved or resized interactively, [ClearAreaLayout](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/ClearAreaLayout) will push away the other elements so there is enough space for the changed node.

## Things to Try

- Drag a node to another location and watch the graph give way to it.
- Enlarge a node and see that the other nodes will move away to avoid overlaps.
- Create a new node beside an existing one, create a copy or duplicate a node without overlaps.
