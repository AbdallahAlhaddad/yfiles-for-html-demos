# Simple Arrow Style Demo

This demo shows how to create a simple custom arrow for edges.

## Things to Try

- Create new nodes and edges between nodes and inspect the custom style of the arrows in code.
- Save the graph to GraphML and take a look at the GraphML â€“ the arrow styles are serialized using a custom markup extension and can be loaded back to the demo.
