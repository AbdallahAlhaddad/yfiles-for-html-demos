This demo shows how HTML can be used for rendering label texts using a custom label style implementation.

Note that the visualizations in this demo do not work in Internet Explorer due to missing SVG `foreign object` support. HTML labels work in MS Edge but repainting has noticeable delays when zooming the viewport.

## HTML Label Editor

#### Creating and Editing Labels

- Press the F2 key while an element or connection is selected.
- Insert **HTML** text into the editor, i.e. `<strong>Hello World</strong>`

#### Styling Labels with CSS

The stylesheet for labels _html-label.css_ shows how the label texts are styled.
