[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/style/directed-edge-label/index.html).

This demo shows a custom label style which visualizes an edge label with an additional arrow which points in the direction of the edge label flow.

## Things to Try

- Move a node around and see how the arrow in the label keeps pointing to the node.
- Note that arrows pointing to the source are always placed left of the text. Arrows pointing to the target are placed right.

See the sources for details.
