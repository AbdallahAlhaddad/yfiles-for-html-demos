This demo shows how CSS3 transformations and animations can be applied to graph items.

## Things to Try

- Create a node by clicking on an empty location on the canvas and watch how the new node is animated.
- Move the mouse over a node to see a simple shine effect.
- Select a node by clicking on it and see the animated selection indicator.

## Browser support

Depending on your browser, some animations might not work correctly or not at all. This demo applies CSS animations and transitions on SVG elements which is not supported by every browser out of the box.
