[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/complete/large-tree/index.html).

The Large Tree Demo uses [WebGL2](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/webgl2) as the rendering technique to display a large tree graph in order to optimize performance.

The graph can be manipulated by adding or removing layers. The child count of new layers can be changed with the slider control.

Adding and removing nodes is animated with layout- as well as WebGL2 fade-animations, running in parallel.

The maximum graph size is limited to 20000 nodes.

### Things to try

Use the controls to manipulate the graph:

- The layers determine the depth of the tree. Click the "+" and "-" buttons to add and remove layers.
- The child count determines the number of children to be added to each leaf when a new layer is added.
