[You can also run this demo online](https://live.yworks.com/demos/complete/isometricwebgl/index.html).

This demo displays graphs isometrically using WebGL, adding another dimension to the node visualizations that can be used to represent an additional characteristic of the business data.

## Interaction

This demo features the full range of interactions using [GraphEditorInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode). Also, each node has an additional handle at the "top" which, when dragged, will change the height of the node.

## Things to Try

- Select a node and drag the handle at the "top" to change the height of that node.
- Drag the "Rotation" slider in the toolbar to change the rotation of the scene.
- Press the "Toggle Grid" button in the toolbar to turn the grid on or off.
- Click on an empty space in the canvas to create a new node with a random color and height.

## Layout

There are two suitable layout algorithms to apply to the graph.

- Hierarchic layout
- Orthogonal layout

## Loading Graphs

Load your own graph and display it isometrically.
